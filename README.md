# Curriculum-Learning

From the easy samples to the hard ones, using curriculum learning can provide performance improvements over the standard training approach based on random data shuffling, without any additional computational costs

Since neural network architectures are inspired by the human brain, it seems reasonable to consider that the learning process should also be inspired by how humans learn. One essential difference from how machines are typically trained is that humans learn the basic (easy) concepts sooner and the advanced (hard) concepts later.

## Dataset

This project used the [Face Mask Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andrewmvd/face-mask-detection) dataset from Kaggle.

**About Dataset:** 

Masks play a crucial role in protecting the health of individuals against respiratory diseases, as is one of the few precautions available for COVID-19 in the absence of immunization. With this dataset, it is possible to create a model to detect people wearing masks, not wearing them, or wearing masks improperly.
This dataset contains 853 images belonging to the 3 classes, as well as their bounding boxes in the PASCAL VOC format.
The classes are:

With mask;
Without mask;
Mask worn incorrectly.
